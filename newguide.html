Creating your character
After you've loaded into the server, you will see 4 empty character slots. To create your character, click the "New Character" button on one of them.


This will open the character creation menu. Here have to fill out your characters first and last name, their birthday, gender and their backstory. Choose wisely, you will not be able to edit this later!

Character Appearance
Once you've completed creating your character, you will be prompted with a menu to change the look of your character to your liking. If you decide to select a non-playable character (Anything other than the freemode models that are selected by default) as your main character, you will not be able to change any clothing, etc. later.


If at any point you would like to change your clothing, you can visit a clothing store to do so! While you can change your clothing, makeup and hairstyle, you will not be able to change things like skin color, face, etc. once finished with the creation of your character.
Getting Started
When you finish your character, you will notice that you spawn at the airport and that you will need to make your way into the city. You will see a popup at the top left of your screen asking you if you want directions to your personal vehicle. When you create a character, you get a free starter car to help you get around the city, you can now claim it by pressing enter. Once you've pressed enter, you can now follow the directions to your car.




If driving is not your thing, you can also walk, use your phone to call a taxi or get a friend to pick you up.
Stores and supplies
Once you've made your way into the city, it's time to get some supplies! You can find a variety of stores around the city that help you cover your basic needs. As you've maybe noticed, your hunger and thirst will slowly decrease over time.


You can purchase food and drinks at grocery stores. You can also purchase a variety of other items at these stores such as phones, bandages, cigarettes, etc. Bandages are useful to have on hand in case you are injured and need to heal yourself, cigarettes are helpful to reduce your stress level.


Grocery stores require you to pay in cash. You start out with some money in your bank account (use /bank to check your balance) and a little bit in cash (/cash to check your cash balance). You can also withdraw more cash from any bank or ATM in the city.

Your phone
Your phone is one of the most useful things in the Legacy server. You can contact emergency services, access Twitter, call your friends, and a few other features. To access the phone, you will want to press "P". To access all the apps, you can click the bottom most button on the phone.
